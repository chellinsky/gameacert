# About Game-A-Cert

Game-A-Cert is a web application that combines traditional training using videos and quizzes with simulations and gamification to enhance the training process when preparing for certification exams.

The web app started as the main product for a startup.  However, the startup pivoted, and the code is now available here for anyone to take and improve or use.

## Motivation

When Game-A-Cert was going to be the main product of a company, here is the text that introduced the idea:

Certification training and exam preparation should be more than listening to a 36-hour lecture.

Too often, preparing for a certification exam means spending a week listening to an "expert" drone on about a topic.  The training might include some activities or practice tests, but it does not inspire deeper learning or provide an easy method to demonstrate the extra value the course brings an employer or client.  Game-A-Cert plans to change this process by using games to simulate real-world situations.  These situations will let gamers learn test material interactively.  At the end of the game, participants will earn a badge they can link to their LinkedIn profile or other social media

Beyond initial certification training, Game-A-Cert will offer continuing learning education across disciplines.  Again, by using a game-centric approach, we will simulate real-world experiences to help gamers advance their professional knowledge.  We will track all continuing learning and work closely with any professional organizations that need participation audits.

## Status

v0.1 - Basic video and quiz system implemented.  Some workarounds in place to make everything work.  The goal was proof-of-concept, not elegance.
